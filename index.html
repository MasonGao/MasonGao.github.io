          Welcome! We are based at the School of Physics, East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST). 
          Our research focuses on <strong>high-energy physics phenomenology</strong>, including jets, perturbative QCD, 
          effective field theory, and top-quark physics, with a particular emphasis on the intersection of artificial intelligence and high-energy physics.
