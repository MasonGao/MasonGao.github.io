## Meisen Gao's Group

Welcome to Meisen Gao's research group at the School of Physics, East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST). 

Our research focuses on theoretical and phenomenological aspects of high-energy particle physics, with emphasis on understanding the fundamental interactions described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We develop advanced theoretical tools and computational methods to make precise predictions for collider experiments, including those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), and other facilities.

### CV

## Research Areas

### Jets & Perturbative QCD

We develop and apply resummation techniques to achieve high-precision predictions for jet observables, including N³LL + O(α_s²) predictions for lepton–jet azimuthal distributions in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and QCD resummation of dijet azimuthal decorrelations.

### Small-*x* QCD & Color Glass Condensate

At very high energies, the density of gluons in hadrons becomes so large that nonlinear effects become important. This regime is described by the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective theory. Our work includes BK evolution fits to HERA data and predictions for the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).

### Top-quark Physics

We study precision measurements involving top quarks, including top-quark mass determination from single-top production and differential distributions for future colliders. We also apply the SMEFT framework to study potential new physics effects.

### Effective Field Theory Applications

We use effective field theory methods, including SMEFT and SCET, to study high-energy processes and develop strategies to disentangle PDF uncertainties from new physics effects.

### AI/ML for High-Energy Physics

We develop machine learning methods to create fast, accurate surrogates for computationally expensive theoretical calculations, enabling efficient comparison with experimental data.
