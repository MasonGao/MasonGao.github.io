## Research Group Overview

Welcome to the **High-Energy Physics Phenomenology Research Group** at the School of Physics, East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST). Our group focuses on theoretical and phenomenological aspects of high-energy particle physics, with emphasis on understanding the fundamental interactions described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).

## Research Philosophy

Our research bridges the gap between fundamental theory and experimental observations in high-energy physics. We develop advanced theoretical tools and computational methods to make precise predictions for collider experiments, including those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), and other facilities.

## Principal Investigator

**Meisen Gao** is a Lecturer at the School of Physics, ECUST. He received his Ph.D. in Physics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2022, followed by postdoctoral research at Fudan University (2022-2025) and a visiting position at UCLA (2024-2025).

### Academic Background

### Research Interests

- **Jets & Perturbative QCD:** Developing high-precision predictions for jet observables using resummation techniques
- **Small-*x* QCD & Color Glass Condensate:** Studying QCD dynamics at high energies and high parton densities
- **Top-quark Physics:** Precision measurements and theoretical calculations involving top quarks at colliders

- **AI/ML in HEP:** Developing machine learning methods as surrogates for computationally expensive theoretical predictions

## Research Highlights

### Color Glass Condensate and Small-*x* QCD

We investigate the behavior of QCD at very high energies, where gluon densities become large and nonlinear effects become important. This research is crucial for understanding experiments at HERA, RHIC, LHC, and the future EIC.

### Jet Phenomenology

Our work on jet physics includes developing state-of-the-art theoretical predictions at N³LL + O(α_s²) accuracy for various jet observables, including dijet azimuthal decorrelations and lepton-jet correlations in deep inelastic scattering.

### AI for Theory Predictions

We are pioneering the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning methods to create fast, accurate surrogates for complex theoretical calculations, enabling efficient comparison with experimental data.
