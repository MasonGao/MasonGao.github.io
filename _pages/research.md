Our research focuses on theoretical high-energy physics phenomenology, with emphasis on quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and its applications to collider physics.

## Jets & Perturbative QCD

We develop and apply resummation techniques to achieve high-precision predictions for jet observables:

- **N³LL + O(α_s²) predictions** for lepton–jet azimuthal distributions in deep inelastic scattering (DIS)
- **QCD resummation** of dijet azimuthal decorrelations in proton-proton (*pp*) and proton-nucleus (*pA*) collisions
- Application of Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) to jet physics
- Investigation of jet substructure to probe fundamental QCD dynamics

## Small-*x* QCD & Color Glass Condensate

At very high energies, the density of gluons in hadrons becomes so large that nonlinear effects become important. This regime is described by the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective theory:

- **BK evolution fits** to HERA deep inelastic scattering data
- Predictions for forward particle production at the LHC
- Phenomenology for the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC)
- **One-point energy correlators** for accessing nucleon transversity
- Transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs)

## Top-quark Physics

The top quark is the heaviest known elementary particle, providing crucial tests of the Standard Model:

- **Top-quark mass determination** from *t*-channel single-top production at the LHC
- Differential distributions for single top-quark production at future colliders
- Top-quark pair production in the context of SMEFT
- Applications of Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) to study potential new physics effects

## Effective Field Theory

We apply effective field theory methods to high-energy processes:

- **Simultaneous extraction** of CTEQ-TEA PDFs and SMEFT parameters from jet and *tt̄* data
- Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) for jet physics
- Strategies to disentangle PDF uncertainties from new physics effects

## AI/ML for High-Energy Physics

We develop machine learning methods to create fast, accurate surrogates for computationally expensive theoretical calculations:

- Neural network emulators for QCD evolution
- Gaussian process regression for theoretical predictions
- Applications to PDF fitting and Monte Carlo event generation
- Event classification and optimization of experimental observables
