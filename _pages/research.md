Our research focuses on various aspects of high-energy physics phenomenology, with emphasis on quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and its applications to collider physics.

## Jets & Perturbative QCD

### Jet Resummation

We develop and apply resummation techniques to achieve high-precision predictions for jet observables. Recent work includes:

- **N³LL + O(α_s²) predictions** for lepton–jet azimuthal distributions in deep inelastic scattering (DIS)
- **QCD resummation** of dijet azimuthal decorrelations in proton-proton (*pp*) and proton-nucleus (*pA*) collisions
- Application of Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) to jet physics

### Jet Substructure

Investigation of the internal structure of jets to probe fundamental QCD dynamics and search for new physics at the LHC.

## Small-*x* QCD & Color Glass Condensate

### High-Energy QCD Dynamics

At very high energies, the density of gluons in hadrons becomes so large that nonlinear effects become important. This regime is described by the **Color Glass Condensate (CGC)** effective theory.

Our research includes:

- **BK evolution fits** to HERA deep inelastic scattering data
- Predictions for forward particle production at the LHC
- Phenomenology for the future **Electron-Ion Collider (EIC)**

### Transverse Momentum Distributions

We study transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) and energy correlators, including:

- **One-point energy correlators** for accessing nucleon transversity
- Connections between energy correlators and TMDs

## Top-quark Physics

### Precision Top-quark Measurements

The top quark is the heaviest known elementary particle, and its properties provide crucial tests of the Standard Model. Our work includes:

- **Top-quark mass determination** from *t*-channel single-top production at the LHC
- Differential distributions for **single top-quark production** at future colliders (e.g., LHeC)
- Top-quark pair production in the context of SMEFT

### Effective Field Theory for Top Physics

We use the **Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT)** framework to study potential new physics effects in top-quark processes.

## Effective Field Theory Applications

### SMEFT Phenomenology

We apply the SMEFT framework to simultaneously extract parton distribution functions (PDFs) and new physics parameters from collider data:

- **Simultaneous extraction** of CTEQ-TEA PDFs and SMEFT parameters from jet and *tt̄* data
- Developing strategies to disentangle PDF uncertainties from new physics effects

### Other EFT Applications

- Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) for jet physics
- Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) applications

## AI/ML for High-Energy Physics

### Machine Learning Surrogates

Theoretical predictions in high-energy physics often require computationally expensive calculations. We develop **machine learning methods** to create fast, accurate surrogates:

- Neural network emulators for QCD evolution
- Gaussian process regression for theoretical predictions
- Applications to PDF fitting and Monte Carlo event generation

### Data Analysis

Applying modern machine learning techniques to:

- Event classification and reconstruction
- Optimization of experimental observables
- Anomaly detection for new physics searches

## Collaborations

We actively collaborate with experimental groups at:

- Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
- Future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC)
- Other international facilities

We also maintain close collaborations with theoretical groups worldwide, including institutions in the US, Europe, and Asia.
