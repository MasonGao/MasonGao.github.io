We actively collaborate with theoretical groups at: [UCLA](https://kang-research-group.physics.ucla.edu/) | [Fudan University](https://shaodingyu.github.io/) | [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://fmnlo.sjtu.edu.cn/)

Our research is closely connected to experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), and the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). We welcome collaborations. If you are interested in working with us, please feel free to contact us.
