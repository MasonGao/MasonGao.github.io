We are based at the School of Physics, East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST). Our research focuses on **high-energy physics phenomenology**, including jets, perturbative QCD, effective field theory, and top-quark physics, with a particular emphasis on the intersection of artificial intelligence and high-energy physics.
